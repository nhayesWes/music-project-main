# music-project

To run our app, first cd into the directory "...COMP333-hw2/music-project-main/music_project". Next, enter our virtual environment, preloaded with Django, by running "source venv/bin/activate" in the Terminal (or whatever your Windows equivalent may be). Now, run "python3 manage.py runserver" and go to the provided URL to begin viewing our web app.

Our web app is divided into multiple pages. One page supports registering users; another supports searching for ratings based on username; and one last one supports searching for all of the songs on a particular album. There is also a home page which links to all three pages.

Our database is preloaded with the provided sample data, as well as the entirety of Paul Simon's Graceland (to show that you can return multiple songs on our "album tracklist view" page).

Feel free to send us an email if any more information is needed. Have a good break!
